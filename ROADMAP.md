### Task: Create a NoSQL Database in Rust with Language Wrappers for Dart and Go

#### Objective:
Build a **high-performance, memory-safe NoSQL database** in **Rust** that can be easily integrated with multiple programming languages. The first two wrappers will be for **Dart** (for Flutter) and **Go**.

### High-Level Features:
1. **Basic NoSQL functionality**: Key-value store with CRUD operations.
2. **Concurrency**: Handle multiple read/write operations efficiently.
3. **Cross-platform support**: Build a library that can be compiled for different operating systems.
4. **Wrappers for Dart and Go**: Create an API that can be called from Dart (Flutter) and Go using FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
5. **Serialization**: Use efficient serialization for objects (consider Protobuf, BSON, or a custom binary format).
6. **Persistence**: Support for disk-based storage with options for in-memory databases.
7. **Transactions**: Provide ACID-like guarantees for atomicity.

### Roadmap

#### **Phase 1: Core Database Design & Implementation (Rust)**

##### **Step 1: Research and Planning (1-2 weeks)**
- **Research NoSQL systems**: Study existing NoSQL databases (e.g., Redis, MongoDB, CouchDB) to gather insights on architecture and best practices.
- **Identify database architecture**: Decide on key-value or document-based store, data structures (hash maps, B-trees, etc.), and storage mechanisms (in-memory vs. persistent).
- **Plan basic functionality**: Key operations like `put`, `get`, `delete`, `update`.
- **Concurrency model**: Design how concurrent reads/writes will be handled (Rust's `Arc`, `Mutex`, or multi-threading primitives).
  
##### **Step 2: Initial Setup and Project Structure (1 week)**
- Set up the Rust project structure using **`cargo`**.
- Define modules:
  - **Storage module**: For managing disk-based/in-memory data storage.
  - **Data structures module**: Implement core data structures (e.g., hash maps, B-trees).
  - **Concurrency module**: Handle thread-safe operations.
  - **Persistence module**: Manage data serialization and storage (e.g., using Protobuf or a custom binary format).
  
##### **Step 3: Core Functionality (4-6 weeks)**
- Implement the key features:
  - **Put**: Insert or update a key-value pair.
  - **Get**: Retrieve the value for a key.
  - **Delete**: Remove a key-value pair.
  - **Update**: Modify the value for a key.
  - **Persistence**: Write data to disk (with file-based storage) or keep in memory for in-memory databases.
  - **Serialization/Deserialization**: Implement a system to serialize/deserialize objects efficiently.
  
##### **Step 4: Concurrency and Thread Safety (2-3 weeks)**
- Ensure that all operations are thread-safe:
  - Use **Rust’s concurrency primitives** (`Arc`, `RwLock`, or `Mutex`) to allow safe multi-threaded reads/writes.
  - Implement benchmarks to evaluate concurrency performance.

##### **Step 5: Add Transactions (Optional, 2-3 weeks)**
- Implement ACID-like transactions to ensure data integrity.
- Consider implementing **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** or a similar model for handling concurrent writes.

#### **Phase 2: Testing and Optimization (3-4 weeks)**

##### **Step 1: Unit Testing**
- Write unit tests for all core database operations.
  
##### **Step 2: Performance Benchmarking**
- Benchmark the performance of the database, focusing on **read/write throughput** and **latency**.
  
##### **Step 3: Optimizations**
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize memory usage, storage access patterns, and concurrency handling.
- Implement **cache mechanisms** for faster reads.

#### **Phase 3: FFI Layer and Dart/Go Wrappers**

##### **Step 1: Expose Rust Functions via FFI (1-2 weeks)**
- Use **`extern "C"`** and Rust’s FFI capabilities to expose core functions (`put`, `get`, `delete`) as C ABI functions.
- Use **`cbindgen`** to generate C headers automatically.
  
##### **Step 2: Dart FFI Wrapper (2-3 weeks)**
- Set up a **Dart FFI wrapper** using the `dart:ffi` package to call Rust functions from Dart.
- Create Dart bindings for core database operations (e.g., `put`, `get`, `delete`).
- Write Dart unit tests to verify functionality.
  
##### **Step 3: Go FFI Wrapper (2-3 weeks)**
- Set up a **Go wrapper** using **CGO** to call Rust functions from Go.
- Create Go bindings for core database operations.
- Write Go tests to ensure the wrapper works correctly.

#### **Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment (2 weeks)**

##### **Step 1: Documentation**
- Write documentation for the Rust API, including how to use the database and configure it.
- Provide usage examples for Dart and Go.

##### **Step 2: Packaging and Distribution**
- Prepare the Rust library for distribution (`.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll` files).
- Write setup instructions for using the database in Dart (Flutter) and Go.

##### **Step 3: Publish**
- Publish the Dart wrapper as a package for Flutter developers.
- Create a Go package that can be used with the Go wrapper.
