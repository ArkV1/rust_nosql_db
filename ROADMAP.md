### Task: Create a NoSQL Database in Rust with Language Wrappers for Dart and Go

#### Objective:
Build a **high-performance, memory-safe NoSQL database** in **Rust** that can be easily integrated with multiple programming languages. The first two wrappers will be for **Dart** (for Flutter) and **Go**.

### High-Level Features:
- [x] **Basic NoSQL functionality**: Key-value store with CRUD operations.
- [x] **Concurrency**: Handle multiple read/write operations efficiently.
- [ ] **Cross-platform support**: Build a library that can be compiled for different operating systems.
- [ ] **Wrappers for Dart and Go**: Create an API that can be called from Dart (Flutter) and Go using FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
- [x] **Serialization**: Use efficient serialization for objects (consider Protobuf, BSON, or a custom binary format).
- [x] **Persistence**: Support for disk-based storage with options for in-memory databases.
- [ ] **Transactions**: Provide ACID-like guarantees for atomicity.
